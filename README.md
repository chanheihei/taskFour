# taskfour

Pre-req
- add chromedriver.exe to C:\Drivers\  (if not already present)

Background
- This was created with Selenium webdriver, because of its opensource availability, multi browsers support and reusability
- Kotlin was chosen because I know it was used in the company from the initia telephone conversation
- I also wanted to learn Kotlin as part of this assessment :)

 Tasks
 - Intalled all the pre-req (IntelliJ, node JS, selenium webdriver, chromedriver)
 - Installed the xpath Plug-Ins for the browsers (FireFox and Chrome) in order to inspect the elements
 - Add the relevant depenedencies to POM
 - Create POM project structure
 - Create HomePage (add the elements, and basic functions)
 - Create HomePageTests (Happy Paths)
 - Repeated the above with SearchPage and AdvancedSearchPage
 - Create / Edit / Run the tests using red > green > refactor > red > green approach
 
 Hurdles
 - where to add chromdriver.exe
 - how to type into search box (as the focused search box have a different element)
 - how to use dynamic xpath
 - some timing issues on the tests
 - add the project to github
 
 To Do
 - Abstract Base Test
 - Abstract repeated Steps
 - Add Unhappy Path Tests
 - Add extra assertions in addition to url check
 - Remove hardcoded the tests
 - Add other browser support in the framework in addition to Chrome
 - Learn how to use Kotlin correctly (I am completely new to Kotlin)
 - Big Refresher for myself on Selenium webdriver (I have been solely focused on iOS native for too long)
